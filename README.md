### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Raul and I'm a 19-year old Brazilian developer(or going to be one). I'm currently studying Computer Science at UTFPR (Universidade TecnolÃ³gica Federal do ParanÃ¡).

Since my childhood I've been in love with computers, playing with the hardware and stuff, but only in programming I found myself. Here you will find college works, challenges from the web and maybe crazy stuffs from my head. I usually use C and Python.
